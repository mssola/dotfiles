The endpoint is supposed to match a systemd service named 'openvpn@<endpoint>.service'.
Note that this command will effectively modify your /etc/resolv.conf file, and
it expects the following files to be available:

  - /etc/resolv.conf.vpn: file containing your DNS records.
  - /etc/resolv.conf.original: your original /etc/resolv.conf file.
