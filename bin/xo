# Before creating this script I used to have a shell alias called `xo` for
# `xdg-open`. This worked well and all, but it failed to open multiple files or
# shell expressions in general (as `xdg-open` does). I used to workaround this
# with piping and shit, but I'm really tired of it. Thus, I've created this
# script which basically does what `xdg-open` was supposed to do (and
# failed). Thus, the usage:
#
#   $ xo [files/shell expression/whatever]
#
# This script will error out if no arguments were given. Other than that, you
# are more than welcome to shoot yourself at the foot.
